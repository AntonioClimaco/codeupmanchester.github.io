            <h2>What is CodeUp?</h2>
            <p>
              Set up by Claire Wicher in early 2015, CodeUp is the adult version of Code Club. Initially running out of borrowed office
              space in central Manchester, the aim was to provide free and friendly adult coding tuition to anyone who wanted
              it. Since then it has grown and evolved into a network of spaces from Preston to Stoke-on-Trent, Chester to
              Leeds, where complete beginners and accomplished software engineers (and everyone in between) can come together
              and share their enjoyment of coding.
            </p>
            <p>
              Three years on, the Manchester branch regularly sees between 40-100 people attend each month, some of whom have gone from
              beginner to professional developer in that time. We also have a team of dedicated mentors who attend almost
              every month, all of whom specialise in several languages and technologies.
            </p>

            <h2>How do I get involved?</h2>
            <p>
              All you have to do is turn up. We would recommend that you bring a laptop, a notepad and a pen, but the rest is up to you.
              Let us know you're coming by RSVPing to the event on our
              <a href="https://www.meetup.com/CodeUpManchester/" target="_blank">Meetup page</a> or join our
              <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/codeupmanchester/shared_invite/enQtMzI4OTYyOTg1NTU1LTAxODBiMzg1YjMxMzhjYmRlN2VjMmE1YTIwYmI2ZDQxZmZhODlhZTVlZWU4OTY3YTU0ZDE2YjQzNDgyMjRiYTU">Slack workspace</a>
              and chat to people there. Feel free to ask questions and share ideas for things to do.
            </p>
            <p>
              People typically start arriving at 6:45pm and most people are in by 7pm. If you can't make 7pm just turn up a bit later.
            </p>

            <h2>What happens?</h2>
            <p>
              We usually start the session with the usual pointers about health and safety and facilities, followed by a quick introduction
              of the mentors, a summary of specific problems/questions and a list of any talks or workshops planned for that
              night. Those people who want to do their own thing can find a seat and get going.
            </p>
            <p>
              We encourage people to share and explain their work to anyone interested, so if you see something interesting on someone's
              screen, go up and ask them about it. Similarly, expect a tap on the shoulder if you're working on something
              exciting.
            </p>

            <h2>Can I be a mentor?</h2>
            <p>
              Definitely! You can RSVP on <a href="https://www.meetup.com/CodeUpManchester/" target="_blank">Meetup</a>, but there's no
              need to do anything specific as a mentor. At the start of the event there is often a quick matching up of people who are 
              looking for help with a particular language, or you can just wander round and see who needs a hand.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you've been a few times and feel like you're becoming part of the furniture, you can submit a picture of yourself and 
              a bit of blurb to Drew to go on the <a href="people.html" target="_blank">people</a> page. However, if you're super-duper
              keen to score bonus respect and kudos, branch off from master on the CodeUpManchester repository with the same name as
              this domain, add yourself to the people page and put in a pull request. ;)
            </p>
