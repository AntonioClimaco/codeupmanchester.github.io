                As the event is held in the evening, we have to use the trade entrance. Approaching from the South, this is on the right,
                about half way up Spear Street.

                From about 6:45pm we have a person waiting behind the gates to let people in. If you can't see anyone, send a message to the
                Meetup or Slack group and we'll try to send someone down.
