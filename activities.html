            CodeUp Manchester occasionally runs workshops. These change over time but we keep all the details and resources

            There are plenty of places to go on the Internet to learn, practice, share and discover more about code, and quite often
            we get people attending who are working their way through resources they've found elsewhere on the web. The following
            are just a few of the ones we see people on, along with some we recommend you try.

            Alexander Kallaway spent a year and a half learning to code and had many ups and downs along the way. He felt his experience
            would be useful to people and so set up #100DaysOfCode, challenging people to code for an hour a day. The challenge
            now has a small army of committed subscribers who share their projects, experiences and progress daily.

            Interested in what life was like when computers were programmed using 4-letter code words and hexadecimal numbers? Well,
            wonder no more. Box-256 is a computer game that challenges you to draw shapes using the kind of limited instruction
            set last seen in the 1960s. Challenging but interesting, even for the most prolific coder.

          </h4>
          <p>
            Code Combat was designed for use in schools but is a great place to start if you're looking to jump straight in. You are
            guided through steps such that you end up designing and implementing the artificial intelligence for a character
            in a computer game. All the graphics are done for you, so you just have to write a few lines of object-oriented
            Python code to get going.

          <p>
            The principle behind Code Wars is that you achieve mastery through challenge, and you can improve your skills by training
            with others. The exercises are real code challenges and can be done in any of 20 different languages. Users are
            encouraged to share and discuss their answers, meaning there's always someone to ask and always some way to learn.
